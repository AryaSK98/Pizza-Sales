## Pizza Sales - Dashboard Creation
The manager of the pizza place, Plato's Pizza, has the transactional data for the year 2015 and needs to answer the following questions:
1. 	What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
2.	How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
3.	What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
4.	What's our average order value?  

A dashboard is created in Excel to answer the these questions.  
The data is collected from Maven Analytics website which was published as a part of Maven Pizza Challenge.
